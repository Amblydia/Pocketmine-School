EasyUI is an intuitive and easy-to-use form library for PocketMine-MP. Designed to let you focus on your project and not on how the library works.

This form library was created by [Dresnite](https://github.com/dresnite)

## Form Types
- [Simple Form](easy-ui/simple-form)
- Modal Form
- Custom Form

## General rules
All the closures passed to EasyUI classes must declare a variable of the class Player as first and only argument, except for the CustomForm submit listener, which also requires FormResponse as second parameter.
