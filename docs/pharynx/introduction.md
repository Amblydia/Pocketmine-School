pharynx is a replacement for DevTools/ConsoleScript (+ DEVirion), but better because:
- It compiles the phar automatically when you start the server.
- It downloads and shades virions for you automatically.
- You don't have to follow PSR-0/PSR-4 conventions. You can put the classes anywhere in src, or multiple classes in one file.
